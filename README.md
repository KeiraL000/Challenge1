# Horiseon Website
This is my first challenge fixing some errors with the code of the Horiseon website. In this challenge I focused on finding errors along with cleaning up the code.

## Things done
A couple things I have updated with this code is...
- I updated the title to be more descriptive
- Deleted unecessary id's to make the file cleaner
- Added img alt's where needed
- Changed footer h2 to it's correct h4
- In css, corrected the footer's h2 to h4
- Cleaned up html and css file

## Gif
